  abstract        = {A health risk appraisal function has been developed for the prediction of stroke using the Framingham Study cohort. The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication), atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram. Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate multifactorial risk factor modification.},

  abstract        = {We sought to modify existing sex-specific health risk appraisal functions (profile functions) for the prediction of first stroke that better assess the effects of the use of antihypertensive medication. Health risk appraisal functions were previously developed from the Framingham Study cohort. These functions were Cox proportional hazards regression models relating age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram, and the use of antihypertensive medication to the occurrence of stroke. Closer examination of the data indicated that antihypertensive therapy effect is present only for systolic blood pressures between 110 and 200 mm Hg. Adjustments to the regressions to better fit the observed data were developed and tested for statistical significance and goodness-of-fit of the model residuals. Modified functions more consistent with the data were developed, and, from these, tables to evaluate 10-year risk of first stroke were computed. The stroke profile can be used for evaluation of the risk of stroke and suggestion of risk factor modification to reduce risk. The effect of antihypertensive therapy in the evaluation of stroke risk can now be better evaluated.},
