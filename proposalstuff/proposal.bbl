  Stratification of population groups according to cardiovascular risk level is
  recommended for primary prevention. To assess whether the Framingham models
  could accurately predict the absolute risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
  and stroke in a large cohort of middle-aged European patients with
  hypertension, and rank individual patients according to actual risk. A
  prospective cohort study comparing the actual risk with that predicted by
  either the Framingham equations or models derived from the INSIGHT study.
  From the INSIGHT prospective trial, conducted in eight countries of Western
  Europe and Israel, we selected 4407 European patients younger than 75 years
  without previous cardiovascular events. None. Major cardiovascular events. In
  this population (45% men, mean age 64.1 years), 124 (2.8%) patients had CHD
  and 96 (2.2%) had strokes after a median follow-up of 3.7 years.
  Overestimation of absolute CHD risk by the Framingham equation was observed
  in all countries (from 2% in the UK to 7% in France), whereas predicted risk
  of stroke was close to the actual risk. However, patients in the highest risk
  quintile within each country had a threefold greater risk of a cardiovascular
  event than those in the lowest quintile. The Framingham models should not be
  used to predict absolute CHD risk in the European population as a whole.
  However, these models may be used within each country, provided that cut-off
  points defining high-risk patients have been determined within each country.%

  Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent
  cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin
  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer
  (CRC). The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin for the primary
  prevention of CVD and several additional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The
  USPSTF also relied on commissioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality
  and total cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms.
  The USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systematically estimate the
  balance of benefits and harms. This recommendation applies to adults aged 40
  years or older without known CVD and without increased bleeding risk. The
  USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention
  of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater
  10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life
  expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin
  daily for at least 10 years. (B recommendation) The decision to initiate
  low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged
  60 to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an
  individual one. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a
  life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose
  aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. Persons who
  place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may
  choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. (C recommendation) The current evidence
  is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating
  aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than
  50 years. (I statement) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the
  balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary
  prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older. (I statement).%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Prediction models are developed to aid healthcare providers in estimating the
  probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present
  (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future
  (prognostic models), to inform their decision-making. However, the
  overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model
  studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all
  aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of
  prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a
  multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)
  initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies
  developing, validating or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic
  or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was
  developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was
  created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a
  3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, healthcare professionals and
  journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering
  group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors.
  The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential
  for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement
  aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study
  regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in
  conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the
  editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended
  that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also
  available at www.tripod-statement.org).%

  The SCORE project was initiated to develop a risk scoring system for use in
  the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical practice.
  The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12 European cohort studies,
  mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 20,5178 persons
  (88,080 women and 11,7098 men) representing 2.7 million person years of
  follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths
  from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease
  was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure of
  exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation
  equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and for non-coronary
  cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk and low-risk
  regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were developed, one based
  on total cholesterol and the other on total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol
  ratio. The risk estimations are displayed graphically in simple risk charts.
  Predictive value of the risk charts was examined by applying them to persons
  aged 45-64; areas under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. The SCORE risk
  estimation system offers direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk
  in a format suited to the constraints of clinical practice.%

   To directly compare the performance and externally validate the three most

  Garvan-using data from electronic health records.  Retrospective cohort
  study.  Payer provider healthcare organisation in Israel.  1 054 815
  members aged 50 to 90 years for comparison between tools and cohorts of
  different age ranges, corresponding to those in each tools' development
  study, for tool specific external validation.  First diagnosis of a major
  osteoporotic fracture (for QFracture and FRAX tools) and hip fractures (for
  all three tools) recorded in electronic health records from 2010 to 2014.
  Observed fracture rates were compared to probabilities predicted
  retrospectively as of 2010.  The observed five year hip fracture rate was
  2.7% and the rate for major osteoporotic fractures was 7.7%. The areas under
  the receiver operating curve (AUC) for hip fracture prediction were 82.7% for
  QFracture, 81.5% for FRAX, and 77.8% for Garvan. For major osteoporotic
  fractures, AUCs were 71.2% for QFracture and 71.4% for FRAX. All the tools
  underestimated the fracture risk, but the average observed to predicted
  ratios and the calibration slopes of FRAX were closest to 1. Tool specific
  validation analyses yielded hip fracture prediction AUCs of 88.0% for
  QFracture (among those aged 30-100 years), 81.5% for FRAX (50-90 years), and
  71.2% for Garvan (60-95 years).  Both QFracture and FRAX had high
  discriminatory power for hip fracture prediction, with QFracture performing
  slightly better. This performance gap was more pronounced in previous
  studies, likely because of broader age inclusion criteria for QFracture
  validations. The simpler FRAX performed almost as well as QFracture for hip
  fracture prediction, and may have advantages if some of the input data
  required for QFracture are not available. However, both tools require
  calibration before implementation.%

  The Framingham Heart Study produced sex-specific coronary heart disease (CHD)
  prediction functions for assessing risk of developing incident CHD in a white
  middle-class population. Concern exists regarding whether these functions can
  be generalized to other populations. To test the validity and
  transportability of the Framingham CHD prediction functions per a National
  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop organized for this purpose.
  Sex-specific CHD functions were derived from Framingham data for prediction
  of coronary death and myocardial infarction. These functions were applied to
  6 prospectively studied, ethnically diverse cohorts (n = 23 424), including
  whites, blacks, Native Americans, Japanese American men, and Hispanic men:
  the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987-1988), Physicians' Health
  Study (1982), Honolulu Heart Program (1980-1982), Puerto Rico Heart Health
  Program (1965-1968), Strong Heart Study (1989-1991), and Cardiovascular
  Health Study (1989-1990). The performance, or ability to accurately predict
  CHD risk, of the Framingham functions compared with the performance of risk
  functions developed specifically from the individual cohorts' data.
  Comparisons included evaluation of the equality of relative risks for
  standard CHD risk factors, discrimination, and calibration. For white men and
  women and for black men and women the Framingham functions performed
  reasonably well for prediction of CHD events within 5 years of follow-up.
  Among Japanese American and Hispanic men and Native American women, the
  Framingham functions systematically overestimated the risk of 5-year CHD
  events. After recalibration, taking into account different prevalences of
  risk factors and underlying rates of developing CHD, the Framingham functions
  worked well in these populations. The sex-specific Framingham CHD prediction
  functions perform well among whites and blacks in different settings and can
  be applied to other ethnic groups after recalibration for differing
  prevalences of risk factors and underlying rates of CHD events.%

  Separate multivariable risk algorithms are commonly used to assess risk of
  specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, ie, coronary
  heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and
  heart failure. The present report presents a single multivariable risk
  function that predicts risk of developing all CVD and of its constituents. We
  used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a
  first CVD event in 8491 Framingham study participants (mean age, 49 years;
  4522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age
  and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general
  CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension,
  smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD
  algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease,
  stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of
  follow-up, 1174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All
  traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted
  P<0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C
  statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments
  to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each
  CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, 1 based on all
  traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based
  predictors. A sex-specific multivariable risk factor algorithm can be
  conveniently used to assess general CVD risk and risk of individual CVD
  events (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease and heart
  failure). The estimated absolute CVD event rates can be used to quantify risk
  and to guide preventive care.%

  Accurate risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is
  essential to effectively balance the risks and benefits of therapy for
  primary prevention. To compare the calibration and discrimination of the new
  American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC)
  ASCVD risk score with alternative risk scores and to explore preventive
  therapy as a cause of the reported risk overestimation using the
  AHA-ACC-ASCVD score. Prospective epidemiologic study of ASCVD. MESA
  (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a community-based, sex-balanced,
  multiethnic cohort. 4227 MESA participants aged 50 to 74 years and without
  diabetes at baseline. Observed and expected events for the AHA-ACC-ASCVD
  score were compared with 4 commonly used risk scores-and their respective end
  points-in MESA after a 10.2-year follow-up. The new AHA-ACC-ASCVD and 3 older
  Framingham-based risk scores overestimated cardiovascular events by 37% to
  154% in men and 8% to 67% in women. Overestimation was noted throughout the
  continuum of risk. In contrast, the Reynolds Risk Score overestimated risk by
  9% in men but underestimated risk by 21% in women. Aspirin, lipid-lowering or
  antihypertensive therapy, and interim revascularization did not explain the
  overestimation. Comparability of MESA with target populations for primary
  prevention and possibility of missed events in MESA. Of the 5 risk scores, 4,
  including the new AHA-ACC-ASCVD score, showed overestimation of risk (25% to
  115%) in a modern, multiethnic cohort without baseline clinical ASCVD. If
  validated, overestimation of ASCVD risk may have substantial implications for
  individual patients and the health care system. National Heart, Lung, and

  Electronic health records (EHRs) are an increasingly common data source for
  clinical risk prediction, presenting both unique analytic opportunities and
  challenges. We sought to evaluate the current state of EHR based risk
  prediction modeling through a systematic review of clinical prediction
  studies using EHR data. We searched PubMed for articles that reported on the
  use of an EHR to develop a risk prediction model from 2009 to 2014. Articles
  were extracted by two reviewers, and we abstracted information on study
  design, use of EHR data, model building, and performance from each
  publication and supplementary documentation. We identified 107 articles from
  15 different countries. Studies were generally very large (median sample
  size = 26 100) and utilized a diverse array of predictors. Most used
  validation techniques (n = 94 of 107) and reported model coefficients for
  reproducibility (n = 83). However, studies did not fully leverage the
  breadth of EHR data, as they uncommonly used longitudinal information
  (n = 37) and employed relatively few predictor variables (median = 27
  variables). Less than half of the studies were multicenter (n = 50) and
  only 26 performed validation across sites. Many studies did not fully address
  biases of EHR data such as missing data or loss to follow-up. Average
  c-statistics for different outcomes were: mortality (0.84), clinical
  prediction (0.83), hospitalization (0.71), and service utilization (0.71).
  EHR data present both opportunities and challenges for clinical risk
  prediction. There is room for improvement in designing such studies.%

  To derive a new cardiovascular disease risk score (QRISK) for the United
  Kingdom and to validate its performance against the established Framingham
  cardiovascular disease algorithm and a newly developed Scottish score
  (ASSIGN). Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from
  general practice. UK practices contributing to the QRESEARCH database. The
  derivation cohort consisted of 1.28 million patients, aged 35-74 years,
  registered at 318 practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007 and who
  were free of diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The validation
  cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices. First recorded
  diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (incident diagnosis between 1 January
  1995 and 1 April 2007): myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease,
  stroke, and transient ischaemic attacks. Risk factors were age, sex, smoking
  status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol to high
  density lipoprotein, body mass index, family history of coronary heart
  disease in first degree relative aged less than 60, area measure of
  deprivation, and existing treatment with antihypertensive agent. A
  cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK) was developed in the derivation
  cohort. In the validation cohort the observed 10 year risk of a
  cardiovascular event was 6.60% (95% confidence interval 6.48% to 6.72%) in
  women and 9.28% (9.14% to 9.43%) in men. Overall the Framingham algorithm
  over-predicted cardiovascular disease risk at 10 years by 35%, ASSIGN by 36%,
  and QRISK by 0.4%. Measures of discrimination tended to be higher for QRISK
  than for the Framingham algorithm and it was better calibrated to the UK
  population than either the Framingham or ASSIGN models. Using QRISK 8.5% of
  patients aged 35-74 are at high risk (20% risk or higher over 10 years)
  compared with 13% when using the Framingham algorithm and 14% when using
  ASSIGN. Using QRISK 34% of women and 73% of men aged 64-75 would be at high
  risk compared with 24% and 86% according to the Framingham algorithm. UK
  estimates for 2005 based on QRISK give 3.2 million patients aged 35-74 at
  high risk, with the Framingham algorithm predicting 4.7 million and ASSIGN
  5.1 million. Overall, 53 668 patients in the validation dataset (9% of the
  total) would be reclassified from high to low risk or vice versa using QRISK
  compared with the Framingham algorithm. QRISK performed at least as well as
  the Framingham model for discrimination and was better calibrated to the UK
  population than either the Framingham model or ASSIGN. QRISK is likely to
  provide more appropriate risk estimates to help identify high risk patients
  on the basis of age, sex, and social deprivation. It is therefore likely to
  be a more equitable tool to inform management decisions and help ensure
  treatments are directed towards those most likely to benefit. It includes
  additional variables which improve risk estimates for patients with a
  positive family history or those on antihypertensive treatment. However,
  since the validation was performed in a similar population to the population
  from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage."
  Further validation in other populations is therefore required.%

  To develop and validate version two of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk
  algorithm (QRISK2) to provide accurate estimates of cardiovascular risk in
  patients from different ethnic groups in England and Wales and to compare its
  performance with the modified version of Framingham score recommended by the
  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Prospective
  open cohort study with routinely collected data from general practice, 1
  January 1993 to 31 March 2008. 531 practices in England and Wales
  contributing to the national QRESEARCH database. 2.3 million patients aged
  35-74 (over 16 million person years) with 140,000 cardiovascular events.
  Overall population (derivation and validation cohorts) comprised 2.22 million
  people who were white or whose ethnic group was not recorded, 22,013 south
  Asian, 11,595 black African, 10,402 black Caribbean, and 19,792 from Chinese
  or other Asian or other ethnic groups. First (incident) diagnosis of
  cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient
  ischaemic attack) recorded in general practice records or linked Office for
  National Statistics death certificates. Risk factors included self assigned
  ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total
  serum cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index,
  family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative under 60
  years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
  renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis. The validation
  statistics indicated that QRISK2 had improved discrimination and calibration
  compared with the modified Framingham score. The QRISK2 algorithm explained
  43% of the variation in women and 38% in men compared with 39% and 35%,
  respectively, by the modified Framingham score. Of the 112,156 patients
  classified as high risk (that is, >or=20% risk over 10 years) by the modified
  Framingham score, 46,094 (41.1%) would be reclassified at low risk with
  QRISK2. The 10 year observed risk among these reclassified patients was 16.6%
  (95% confidence interval 16.1% to 17.0%)-that is, below the 20% treatment
  threshold. Of the 78 024 patients classified at high risk on QRISK2, 11,962
  (15.3%) would be reclassified at low risk by the modified Framingham score.
  The 10 year observed risk among these patients was 23.3% (22.2% to
  24.4%)-that is, above the 20% threshold. In the validation cohort, the annual
  incidence rate of cardiovascular events among those with a QRISK2 score of
  >or=20% was 30.6 per 1000 person years (29.8 to 31.5) for women and 32.5 per
  1000 person years (31.9 to 33.1) for men. The corresponding figures for the
  modified Framingham equation were 25.7 per 1000 person years (25.0 to 26.3)
  for women and 26.4 (26.0 to 26.8) for men). At the 20% threshold, the
  population identified by QRISK2 was at higher risk of a CV event than the
  population identified by the Framingham score. Incorporating ethnicity,
  deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk
  of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at
  high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20% threshold,
  QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment
  decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the
  validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which
  the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further
  validation in other populations is therefore advised.%

  A fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) is developed based on the use of
  clinical risk factors with or without bone mineral density tests applied to
  the UK. The aim of this study was to apply an assessment tool for the
  prediction of fracture in men and women with the use of clinical risk factors
  (CRFs) for fracture with and without the use of femoral neck bone mineral
  density (BMD). The clinical risk factors, identified from previous
  meta-analyses, comprised body mass index (BMI, as a continuous variable), a
  prior history of fracture, a parental history of hip fracture, use of oral
  glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis and other secondary causes of
  osteoporosis, current smoking, and alcohol intake 3 or more units daily. Four
  models were constructed to compute fracture probabilities based on the
  epidemiology of fracture in the UK. The models comprised the ten-year
  probability of hip fracture, with and without femoral neck BMD, and the
  ten-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture, with and without BMD.
  For each model fracture and death hazards were computed as continuous
  functions. Each clinical risk factor contributed to fracture probability. In
  the absence of BMD, hip fracture probability in women with a fixed BMI (25
  kg/m(2)) ranged from 0.2% at the age of 50 years for women without CRF's to
  22% at the age of 80 years with a parental history of hip fracture
  (approximately 100-fold range). In men, the probabilities were lower, as was
  the range (0.1 to 11% in the examples above). For a major osteoporotic
  fracture the probabilities ranged from 3.5% to 31% in women, and from 2.8% to
  15% in men in the example above. The presence of one or more risk factors
  increased probabilities in an incremental manner. The differences in
  probabilities between men and women were comparable at any given T-score and
  age, except in the elderly where probabilities were higher in women than in
  men due to the higher mortality of the latter. The models provide a framework
  which enhances the assessment of fracture risk in both men and women by the
  integration of clinical risk factors alone and/or in combination with BMD.%

  Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which
  patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, as well as to
  risk-adjust readmission rates for the purposes of hospital comparison. To
  summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their
  performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use. The
  databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from
  inception through March 2011, the EMBASE database was searched through August
  2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual
  review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of
  prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and
  validation cohorts. Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample
  size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and
  calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection. Of 7843
  citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion
  criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model
  specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied
  on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust
  readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large
  US populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range:
  0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk
  patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range:
  0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range:
  0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and
  2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model
  discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical
  comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables
  associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social
  determinants of health. Most current readmission risk prediction models that
  were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly.
  Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve
  their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread.%

  As physicians are pressured to deliver an increasing number of preventive

  with how much control they have over their time. A secondary analysis was
  conducted with data from 3 parallel studies of clinical decision making in
  Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States with 128 physicians per
  country. Physicians reported how much time they were allocated and how much
  time they needed for high-quality care for new patient appointments, routine
  consultations, and complete physicals. They also reported how much control
  they had over their time in the office and spending adequate time with
  patients. German, British, and American physicians were allocated (on
  average) 16/11/32 minutes for a new patient appointment, 6/10/18 minutes for
  a routine visit, and 12/20/36 minutes for a complete physical, but felt that
  they needed more time. Over half of German and American physicians felt that
  they always or usually had control over the hours they were required to be in
  their office or spending sufficient time with their patients while less than
  half of British physicians felt this way. German physicians had the least
  time allocated and needed for most types of appointment. American physicians
  had the most time allocated and needed for each type of appointment. However,
  British physicians felt they had the least control over time in their office
  and spending sufficient time with patients.%

  2011. Prospective cohort study of 14,357 participants (282,097 person-years)
  free of stroke at baseline was facilitated in 4 different US communities.
  Participants were recruited for the purpose of studying all stroke
  hospitalizations and deaths and for collection of baseline information on
  cardiovascular risk factors (via interviews and physical examinations) in
  1987-1989. Participants were followed up (via examinations, annual phone
  interviews, active surveillance of discharges from local hospitals, and
  linkage with the National Death Index) through December 31, 2011. The study
  physician reviewers adjudicated all possible strokes and classified them as
  definite or probable ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Trends in rates of
  first-ever stroke per 10 years of calendar time were estimated using Poisson
  regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with subsequent mortality analyzed
  using Cox proportional hazards regression models and hazard ratios (HRs)
  overall and by race, sex, and age divided at 65 years. Among 1051 (7%)
  participants with incident stroke, there were 929 with incident ischemic
  stroke and 140 with incident hemorrhagic stroke (18 participants had both
  during the study period). Crude incidence rates were 3.73 (95% CI, 3.51-3.96)
  per 1000 person-years for total stroke, 3.29 (95% CI, 3.08-3.50) per 1000
  person-years for ischemic stroke, and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.41-0.57) per 1000
  person-years for hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke incidence decreased over time in
  white and black participants (age-adjusted IRRs per 10-year period, 0.76 [95%
  CI, 0.66-0.87]; absolute decrease of 0.93 per 1000 person-years overall). The
  decrease in age-adjusted incidence was evident in participants age 65 years
  and older (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.81];
  absolute decrease of 1.35 per 1000 person-years) but not evident in
  participants younger than 65 years (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.97
  [95% CI, 0.76-1.25]; absolute decrease of 0.09 per 1000 person-years)
  (P = .02 for interaction). The decrease in incidence was similar by sex.
  Of participants with incident stroke, 614 (58%) died through 2011. The
  mortality rate was higher for hemorrhagic stroke (68%) than for ischemic
  stroke (57%). Overall, mortality after stroke decreased over time (hazard
  ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.98]; absolute decrease of 8.09 per 100
  strokes after 10 years [per 10-year period]). The decrease in mortality was
  mostly accounted for by the decrease at younger than age 65 years (HR, 0.65
  [95% CI, 0.46-0.93]; absolute decrease of 14.19 per 100 strokes after 10
  years [per 10-year period]), but was similar across race and sex. In a
  multicenter cohort of black and white adults in US communities, stroke
  incidence and mortality rates decreased from 1987 to 2011. The decreases
  varied across age groups, but were similar across sex and race, showing that
  improvements in stroke incidence and outcome continued to 2011.%

  Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in
  populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health
  policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
  Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and
  21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals
  (UIs), separately by age and sex. We attempted to identify all available data
  on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital
  registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys,
  hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for
  completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and
  probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to
  estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the
  data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death
  Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical
  models testing a large set of different models using different permutations
  of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We
  assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction
  error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of
  deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For
  27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the
  cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component
  causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database.
  For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping
  cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E,
  and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on
  incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause
  fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and
  meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney
  disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to
  collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock
  regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both
  parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification
  where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every
  age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty
  distributions. In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most
  aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes
  were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of
  46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in
  mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower
  respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from
  3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus
  (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30
  million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in
  2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17
  million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010.
  Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between
  1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million)
  worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than
  two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus,
  and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9
  million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in
  five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in
  1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was
  marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%).
  This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic
  accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic
  heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower
  respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of
  death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke,
  diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of
  life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was
  estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs
  from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since
  1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional
  variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable,
  maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of
  premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death
  rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes
  mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases,
  death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases,
  COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For
  other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little
  change was noted. Population growth, increased average age of the world's
  population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and
  cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable,
  maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases.
  Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain
  the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general
  pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists
  in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer,
  diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and
  others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound
  epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. Bill &

  Clinical prediction models are increasingly used to complement clinical
  reasoning and decision-making in modern medicine, in general, and in the
  cardiovascular domain, in particular. To these ends, developed models first
  and foremost need to provide accurate and (internally and externally)
  validated estimates of probabilities of specific health conditions or
  outcomes in the targeted individuals. Subsequently, the adoption of such
  models by professionals must guide their decision-making, and improve patient
  outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of care. In the first paper of this
  series of two companion papers, issues relating to prediction model
  development, their internal validation, and estimating the added value of a
  new (bio)marker to existing predictors were discussed. In this second paper,
  an overview is provided of the consecutive steps for the assessment of the
  model's predictive performance in new individuals (external validation
  studies), how to adjust or update existing models to local circumstances or
  with new predictors, and how to investigate the impact of the uptake of
  prediction models on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes (impact
  studies). Each step is illustrated with empirical examples from the
  cardiovascular field.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in low-income
  and middle-income countries. We sought to quantify the importance of
  potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke in different regions of the
  world, and in key populations and primary pathological subtypes of stroke. We
  completed a standardised international case-control study in 32 countries in
  Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Cases were
  patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptom onset and 72 h of
  hospital admission). Controls were hospital-based or community-based
  individuals with no history of stroke, and were matched with cases, recruited
  in a 1:1 ratio, for age and sex. All participants completed a clinical
  assessment and were requested to provide blood and urine samples. Odds ratios
  (OR) and their population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, with 99%
  confidence intervals. Between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015, 26 919
  participants were recruited from 32 countries (13 447 cases [10 388 with
  ischaemic stroke and 3059 intracerebral haemorrhage] and 13 472 controls).
  Previous history of hypertension or blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher
  (OR 2·98, 99% CI 2·72-3·28; PAR 47·9%, 99% CI 45·1-50·6), regular
  physical activity (0·60, 0·52-0·70; 35·8%, 27·7-44·7), apolipoprotein
  (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (1·84, 1·65-2·06 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26·8%,
  22·2-31·9 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), diet (0·60, 0·53-0·67
  for highest vs lowest tertile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index
  [mAHEI]; 23·2%, 18·2-28·9 for lowest two tertiles vs highest tertile of
  mAHEI), waist-to-hip ratio (1·44, 1·27-1·64 for highest vs lowest tertile;
  18·6%, 13·3-25·3 for top two tertiles vs lowest), psychosocial factors
  (2·20, 1·78-2·72; 17·4%, 13·1-22·6), current smoking (1·67,
  1·49-1·87; 12·4%, 10·2-14·9), cardiac causes (3·17, 2·68-3·75; 9·1%,
  8·0-10·2), alcohol consumption (2·09, 1·64-2·67 for high or heavy
  episodic intake vs never or former drinker; 5·8%, 3·4-9·7 for current
  alcohol drinker vs never or former drinker), and diabetes mellitus (1·16,
  1·05-1·30; 3·9%, 1·9-7·6) were associated with all stroke. Collectively,
  these risk factors accounted for 90·7% of the PAR for all stroke worldwide
  (91·5% for ischaemic stroke, 87·1% for intracerebral haemorrhage), and were
  consistent across regions (ranging from 82·7% in Africa to 97·4% in
  southeast Asia), sex (90·6% in men and in women), and age groups (92·2% in
  patients aged ≤55 years, 90·0% in patients aged >55 years). We observed
  regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, which were
  related to variations in the magnitude of ORs (rather than direction, which
  we observed for diet) and differences in prevalence of risk factors among
  regions. Hypertension was more associated with intracerebral haemorrhage than
  with ischaemic stroke, whereas current smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins,
  and cardiac causes were more associated with ischaemic stroke (p<0·0001).
  Ten potentially modifiable risk factors are collectively associated with
  about 90% of the PAR of stroke in each major region of the world, among
  ethnic groups, in men and women, and in all ages. However, we found important
  regional variations in the relative importance of most individual risk
  factors for stroke, which could contribute to worldwide variations in
  frequency and case-mix of stroke. Our findings support developing both global
  and region-specific programmes to prevent stroke. Canadian Institutes of

  \field{abstract}{%
  Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated
  to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing
  predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated
  predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that
  discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We
  propose a representation of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the
  Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that
  deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately
  predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without
  site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using
  de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical centers with 216,221
  adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 hours. In the sequential format
  we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945
  data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high
  accuracy for tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality (AUROC across
  sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged
  length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge
  diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed
  state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all cases. We also present
  a case-study of a neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how
  clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions. We believe that
  this approach can be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a
  variety of clinical scenarios, complete with explanations that directly
  highlight evidence in the patient's chart.%

  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in
  Europe and the United States. Survival is strongly related to stage at
  diagnosis and population-based screening reduces colorectal cancer incidence
  and mortality. Stratifying the population by risk offers the potential to
  improve the efficiency of screening. In this systematic review we searched
  Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for primary research studies
  reporting or validating models to predict future risk of primary colorectal
  cancer for asymptomatic individuals. A total of 12,808 papers were identified
  from the literature search and nine through citation searching. Fifty-two
  risk models were included. Where reported (n = 37), half the models had
  acceptable-to-good discrimination (the area under the receiver operating
  characteristic curve, AUROC >0.7) in the derivation sample. Calibration was
  less commonly assessed (n = 21), but overall acceptable. In external
  validation studies, 10 models showed acceptable discrimination (AUROC
  0.71-0.78). These include two with only three variables (age, gender, and
  BMI; age, gender, and family history of colorectal cancer). A small number of
  prediction models developed from case-control studies of genetic biomarkers
  also show some promise but require further external validation using
  population-based samples. Further research should focus on the feasibility
  and impact of incorporating such models into stratified screening
  programmes.%

  It is proposed that 20% to 40% of the decline in first-ever stroke incidence
  is attributed to the improvement of risk factor control. We estimated the
  impact of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors on the changing incidence of
  ischemic stroke (IS) between 1995 and 2012, using individual person data from
  repeated surveys in a general population. The proportion of the IS incidence
  decline explained by change in each risk factor over time was estimated from
  1995 to 2012 by Poisson regression among 26 329 participants who attended
  the fourth Tromsø survey in 1994 to 1995. Hazard ratios for IS were
  estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression among 27 936
  participants who attended at least 1 of the Tromsø surveys in 1994 to 1995,
  2001, or 2007 to 2008. Age- and sex-adjusted means or prevalences of risk
  factors over time were estimated by generalized estimating equations. There
  were 1226 first-ever IS during 367 636 person-years of follow-up. Changes
  in cardiovascular risk factors accounted for 57% of the decrease in IS
  incidence from 1995 to 2012. The most important contributors were decreasing
  mean systolic blood pressure and smoking prevalence, accounting for 26% and
  17% of the observed decline, respectively. Conversely, increasing diabetes
  mellitus prevalence contributed negatively to the declining IS incidence.
  Changes in cardiovascular risk factors explained 57% of the decrease in IS
  incidence from 1995 to 2012. Reduction in systolic blood pressure and
  prevalence of smoking were the most important contributors.%

  The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National
  Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program
  (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to
  incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the
  discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical
  prediction functions. This work was designed as a prospective, single-center
  study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men
  and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up.
  During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed
  CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure,
  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P<.001).
  Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk
  according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and
  NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this
  categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the
  continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other
  factors, approximately 28% of CHD events in men and 29% in women were
  attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (> or
  =130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent
  associated with elevated total cholesterol (> or =200 mg/dL) was 27% in men
  and 34% in women. Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total
  cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a
  middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction
  algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians
  to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.%

  Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs
  in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of
  risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the
  effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of
  the world is unknown. We established a standardised case-control study of
  acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited
  continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of
  smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary
  patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins
  (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here.
  Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to
  myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were
  calculated. Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7% for
  current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest
  quintile, PAR 49.2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of
  hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9%), abdominal obesity
  (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR
  20.1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67,
  PAR 32.5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0.70, PAR 13.7% for
  lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0.91, PAR 6.7%), and
  regular physical activity (0.86, PAR 12.2%), were all significantly related
  to acute myocardial infarction (p<0.0001 for all risk factors and p=0.03 for
  alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and
  in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted
  for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Abnormal lipids, smoking,
  hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption
  of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for
  most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all
  ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can
  be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent
  most premature cases of myocardial infarction.%
