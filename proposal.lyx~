\begin_layout Part
Aim of the Thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this thesis is to detail an intervention in the Clalit Health
 Services (CHS) population meant to reduce the incidence of primary stroke.
 This intervention will take two approaches:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A direct to patient intervention via a mobile app to encourage better risk
 management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A family physician centered intervention to encourage better prevention
 via careful adherence to existing guidelines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this overarching goal, several steps will be taken:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The intervention requires a well-calibrated, discrimnative risk model for
 stroke.
 This model will be used both to identify high-risk patients for the family
 physicians and to provide the patient with an accurate estimation of his
 stroke risk.
 To this end we will externally validate existing international cardiovascular
 disease and stroke models on the Israeli population.
 We will comprehensively test the performance of several leading existing
 models and detail their predictive performance.
 This will be done both in the models' original population composition and
 on a shared common population between all models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As international models in general and CVD prediction models specifically
 are notorious for being miscalibrated on different, newer and ethnically
 diverse populations, we will develop a new predictive model for stroke
 specifically tailored for the Israeli population.
 This model will be developed using state of the art statistical and machine
 learning tools, utilizing methods that are as of yet not common in the
 medical field.
 The development of such a model specifically for the Israeli population,
 couped with the use of said methods and algorithms should enable this model
 to outperform all existing models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We will use the leading model from the previous steps in two intervention
 routes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A direct-to-patient intervention in which a stroke model will be embedded
 in an existing application.
 This model will calculate a patient's risk for stroke based on his known
 clinical and demographic characteristics, display said risk compared to
 a population standard, and will also allow the patient to examine how his
 risk changes as clinical characteristics are varied.
 We hope that such a presentation will encourage the users to better manage
 their risk scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An intervention through the patients' family physicians, in which the names
 and IDs of high risk patients will be distributed to the treating physicians
 together with existing prevention guidelines.
 This should aid the treating physicians in identifying their highest-risk
 patients and treating them accordingly.

\begin_layout Part
The Novelty of the Thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All aforementioned steps have a measure of novelty to them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An external validation of existing CVD and stroke risk models has yet to
 be performed on the Israeli population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This will be a the first time a model will be developed to predict stroke
 in the CHS population, and this model will be developed and tested with
 a design model that is not commonly used in the medical field, as will
 be detailed later in this proposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The intervention through the family physicians, that uses the electronic
 health record to generate a concise coupling of high-risk / seemingly undertrea
ted patients and published guidelines, is a unique intervention model, that
 can only be performed by a research institute that resides within a large
 provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While there are examples of mobile applications that allow a patient to
 examine his risk of cardiovascular outcomes, none have access to the patient's
 electronic medical record and are thus capable of using clinical parameters
 that most patients are not aware of.
 Additionally, the application will be specifically geared towards empowering
 a patient to better manage his stroke risk.
 Lastly, combined with follow-up in the electronic health record, we will
 be in a unique position to judge the effectivness of such an intervention,
 which is to the best of our knowledge something that has yet to be done.

Research Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The population for all different parts of the study is the population of
 patients insured by Clalit Health Services (CHS).
 CHS is the largest sick fund in Israel, with an insured population of 4.4
 active members.
 Clalit is both an insurer and a provider, directly providing primary care,
 specialist care, lab, imaging and pharamacy services.
 Additionally, clalit directly operates several large hospitals.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

attrition rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the percentage of patients leaving the sick fund each year) stands on
 a low 1%, allowing long term follow-up of patients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The data will be collected using the CHS's electronic health record (EHR).
 CHS has maintained a comprehensive electronic health record since the year
 2000, and has continued to improve it with time.
 This EHR contains, among others, demographic data, medical data (including
 clinical covariates, lab results, imaging studies, etc.) and claims data
 for both services rendered as part of the mandatory health insurance and
 for services rendered as part of the additive insurance (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

).
 This comprehensive database, combining both medical and claims data, covers
 large facets of a person's health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
something about the procedures (

\end_inset

the raw data is not always fitting...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and our vast experience with the data, that allows dealing with a lot
 of the weaknesses of EHR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
something about the methodology of external validation.
 2 tests for every model, ex.
 val and comparing.
 discrimination, calibration, confusion matrix, decision curves, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Something about the methodology of developing our own model, including the
 follow-up time, the outcome definitions, the use of clinical counsel, the
 different covariates (more than anyone uses), the use of ML technique (10-fold-
CV, random search, etc.), the use of ML models (LASSO, xgboost, ANNs), the
 careful testing, etc.
 Something about the use of competing risks?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Something about the app

\begin_layout Itemize

 and AF related populations
