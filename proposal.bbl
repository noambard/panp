    \field{abstract}{%
    Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in low-income
  and middle-income countries. We sought to quantify the importance of
  potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke in different regions of the
  world, and in key populations and primary pathological subtypes of stroke. We
  completed a standardised international case-control study in 32 countries in
  Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Cases were
  patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptom onset and 72 h of
  hospital admission). Controls were hospital-based or community-based
  individuals with no history of stroke, and were matched with cases, recruited
  in a 1:1 ratio, for age and sex. All participants completed a clinical
  assessment and were requested to provide blood and urine samples. Odds ratios
  (OR) and their population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, with 99%
  confidence intervals. Between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015, 26 919
  participants were recruited from 32 countries (13 447 cases [10 388 with
  ischaemic stroke and 3059 intracerebral haemorrhage] and 13 472 controls).
  Previous history of hypertension or blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher
  (OR 2·98, 99% CI 2·72-3·28; PAR 47·9%, 99% CI 45·1-50·6), regular
  physical activity (0·60, 0·52-0·70; 35·8%, 27·7-44·7), apolipoprotein
  (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (1·84, 1·65-2·06 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26·8%,
  22·2-31·9 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), diet (0·60, 0·53-0·67
  for highest vs lowest tertile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index
  [mAHEI]; 23·2%, 18·2-28·9 for lowest two tertiles vs highest tertile of
  mAHEI), waist-to-hip ratio (1·44, 1·27-1·64 for highest vs lowest tertile;
  18·6%, 13·3-25·3 for top two tertiles vs lowest), psychosocial factors
  (2·20, 1·78-2·72; 17·4%, 13·1-22·6), current smoking (1·67,
  1·49-1·87; 12·4%, 10·2-14·9), cardiac causes (3·17, 2·68-3·75; 9·1%,
  8·0-10·2), alcohol consumption (2·09, 1·64-2·67 for high or heavy
  episodic intake vs never or former drinker; 5·8%, 3·4-9·7 for current
  alcohol drinker vs never or former drinker), and diabetes mellitus (1·16,
  1·05-1·30; 3·9%, 1·9-7·6) were associated with all stroke. Collectively,
  these risk factors accounted for 90·7% of the PAR for all stroke worldwide
  (91·5% for ischaemic stroke, 87·1% for intracerebral haemorrhage), and were
  consistent across regions (ranging from 82·7% in Africa to 97·4% in
  southeast Asia), sex (90·6% in men and in women), and age groups (92·2% in
  patients aged ≤55 years, 90·0% in patients aged >55 years). We observed
  regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, which were
  related to variations in the magnitude of ORs (rather than direction, which
  we observed for diet) and differences in prevalence of risk factors among
  regions. Hypertension was more associated with intracerebral haemorrhage than
  with ischaemic stroke, whereas current smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins,
  and cardiac causes were more associated with ischaemic stroke (p<0·0001).
  Ten potentially modifiable risk factors are collectively associated with
  about 90% of the PAR of stroke in each major region of the world, among
  ethnic groups, in men and women, and in all ages. However, we found important
  regional variations in the relative importance of most individual risk
  factors for stroke, which could contribute to worldwide variations in
  frequency and case-mix of stroke. Our findings support developing both global
  and region-specific programmes to prevent stroke. Canadian Institutes of

    Prior studies have shown decreases in stroke mortality over time, but data
  on validated stroke incidence and long-term trends by race are limited. To
  study trends in stroke incidence and subsequent mortality among black and
  white adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort from
  1987 to 2011. Prospective cohort study of 14,357 participants (282,097
  person-years) free of stroke at baseline was facilitated in 4 different US
  communities. Participants were recruited for the purpose of studying all
  stroke hospitalizations and deaths and for collection of baseline information
  on cardiovascular risk factors (via interviews and physical examinations) in
  1987-1989. Participants were followed up (via examinations, annual phone
  interviews, active surveillance of discharges from local hospitals, and
  linkage with the National Death Index) through December 31, 2011. The study
  physician reviewers adjudicated all possible strokes and classified them as
  definite or probable ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Trends in rates of
  first-ever stroke per 10 years of calendar time were estimated using Poisson
  regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with subsequent mortality analyzed
  using Cox proportional hazards regression models and hazard ratios (HRs)
  overall and by race, sex, and age divided at 65 years. Among 1051 (7%)
  participants with incident stroke, there were 929 with incident ischemic
  stroke and 140 with incident hemorrhagic stroke (18 participants had both
  during the study period). Crude incidence rates were 3.73 (95% CI, 3.51-3.96)
  per 1000 person-years for total stroke, 3.29 (95% CI, 3.08-3.50) per 1000
  person-years for ischemic stroke, and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.41-0.57) per 1000
  person-years for hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke incidence decreased over time in
  white and black participants (age-adjusted IRRs per 10-year period, 0.76 [95%
  CI, 0.66-0.87]; absolute decrease of 0.93 per 1000 person-years overall). The
  decrease in age-adjusted incidence was evident in participants age 65 years
  and older (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.81];
  absolute decrease of 1.35 per 1000 person-years) but not evident in
  participants younger than 65 years (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.97
  [95% CI, 0.76-1.25]; absolute decrease of 0.09 per 1000 person-years)
  (P = .02 for interaction). The decrease in incidence was similar by sex.
  Of participants with incident stroke, 614 (58%) died through 2011. The
  mortality rate was higher for hemorrhagic stroke (68%) than for ischemic
  stroke (57%). Overall, mortality after stroke decreased over time (hazard
  ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.98]; absolute decrease of 8.09 per 100
  strokes after 10 years [per 10-year period]). The decrease in mortality was
  mostly accounted for by the decrease at younger than age 65 years (HR, 0.65
  [95% CI, 0.46-0.93]; absolute decrease of 14.19 per 100 strokes after 10
  years [per 10-year period]), but was similar across race and sex. In a
  multicenter cohort of black and white adults in US communities, stroke
  incidence and mortality rates decreased from 1987 to 2011. The decreases
  varied across age groups, but were similar across sex and race, showing that
  improvements in stroke incidence and outcome continued to 2011.%

    It is proposed that 20% to 40% of the decline in first-ever stroke
  incidence is attributed to the improvement of risk factor control. We
  estimated the impact of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors on the
  changing incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) between 1995 and 2012, using
  individual person data from repeated surveys in a general population. The
  proportion of the IS incidence decline explained by change in each risk
  factor over time was estimated from 1995 to 2012 by Poisson regression among
  26 329 participants who attended the fourth Tromsø survey in 1994 to 1995.
  Hazard ratios for IS were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression
  among 27 936 participants who attended at least 1 of the Tromsø surveys in
  1994 to 1995, 2001, or 2007 to 2008. Age- and sex-adjusted means or
  prevalences of risk factors over time were estimated by generalized
  estimating equations. There were 1226 first-ever IS during 367 636
  person-years of follow-up. Changes in cardiovascular risk factors accounted
  for 57% of the decrease in IS incidence from 1995 to 2012. The most important
  contributors were decreasing mean systolic blood pressure and smoking
  prevalence, accounting for 26% and 17% of the observed decline, respectively.
  Conversely, increasing diabetes mellitus prevalence contributed negatively to
  the declining IS incidence. Changes in cardiovascular risk factors explained
  57% of the decrease in IS incidence from 1995 to 2012. Reduction in systolic
  blood pressure and prevalence of smoking were the most important
  contributors.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint
  National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education
  Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk,
  to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the
  discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical
  prediction functions. This work was designed as a prospective, single-center
  study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men
  and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up.
  During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed
  CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure,
  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P<.001).
  Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk
  according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and
  NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this
  categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the
  continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other
  factors, approximately 28% of CHD events in men and 29% in women were
  attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (> or
  =130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent
  associated with elevated total cholesterol (> or =200 mg/dL) was 27% in men
  and 34% in women. Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total
  cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a
  middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction
  algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians
  to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.%

    The SCORE project was initiated to develop a risk scoring system for use in
  the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical practice.
  The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12 European cohort studies,
  mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 20,5178 persons
  (88,080 women and 11,7098 men) representing 2.7 million person years of
  follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths
  from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease
  was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure of
  exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation
  equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and for non-coronary
  cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk and low-risk
  regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were developed, one based
  on total cholesterol and the other on total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol
  ratio. The risk estimations are displayed graphically in simple risk charts.
  Predictive value of the risk charts was examined by applying them to persons
  aged 45-64; areas under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. The SCORE risk
  estimation system offers direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk
  in a format suited to the constraints of clinical practice.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Separate multivariable risk algorithms are commonly used to assess risk of
  specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, ie, coronary
  heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and
  heart failure. The present report presents a single multivariable risk
  function that predicts risk of developing all CVD and of its constituents. We
  used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a
  first CVD event in 8491 Framingham study participants (mean age, 49 years;
  4522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age
  and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general
  CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension,
  smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD
  algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease,
  stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of
  follow-up, 1174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All
  traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted
  P<0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C
  statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments
  to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each
  CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, 1 based on all
  traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based
  predictors. A sex-specific multivariable risk factor algorithm can be
  conveniently used to assess general CVD risk and risk of individual CVD
  events (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease and heart
  failure). The estimated absolute CVD event rates can be used to quantify risk
  and to guide preventive care.%

    Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent
  cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin
  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer
  (CRC). The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin for the primary
  prevention of CVD and several additional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The
  USPSTF also relied on commissioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality
  and total cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms.
  The USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systematically estimate the
  balance of benefits and harms. This recommendation applies to adults aged 40
  years or older without known CVD and without increased bleeding risk. The
  USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention
  of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater
  10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life
  expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin
  daily for at least 10 years. (B recommendation) The decision to initiate
  low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged
  60 to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an
  individual one. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a
  life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose
  aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. Persons who
  place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may
  choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. (C recommendation) The current evidence
  is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating
  aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than
  50 years. (I statement) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the
  balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary
  prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older. (I statement).%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of
  incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been
  compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood
  pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. We used
  linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER
  (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health
  Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients, 30 years
  of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of
  whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the
  heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood
  pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the
  lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free
  life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80
  years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371.
  During 5·2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular
  disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular
  disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm Hg and
  diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped
  increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure
  varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no
  effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for
  intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1·44 [95% CI 1·32-1·58]),
  subarachnoid haemorrhage (1·43 [1·25-1·63]), and stable angina (1·41
  [1·36-1·46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1·08
  [1·00-1·17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood
  pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and
  peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a
  greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic
  pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic
  aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [95% CI 0·86-0·98]) and strongest for
  peripheral arterial disease (1·23 [1·20-1·27]). People with hypertension
  (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering
  drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of
  age of 63·3% (95% CI 62·9-63·8) compared with 46·1% (45·5-46·8) for
  those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0
  years earlier (95% CI 4·8-5·2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for
  most (43%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated
  with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable
  angina accounted for the largest proportion (19% each) of years of life lost
  from index age 80 years. The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has
  strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across
  a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are
  concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study.
  Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is
  substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood
  pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of
  randomised trials to assess them. Medical Research Council, National

    \field{abstract}{%
    Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in
  populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health
  policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
  Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and
  21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals
  (UIs), separately by age and sex. We attempted to identify all available data
  on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital
  registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys,
  hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for
  completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and
  probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to
  estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the
  data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death
  Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical
  models testing a large set of different models using different permutations
  of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We
  assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction
  error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of
  deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For
  27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the
  cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component
  causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database.
  For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping
  cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E,
  and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on
  incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause
  fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and
  meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney
  disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to
  collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock
  regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both
  parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification
  where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every
  age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty
  distributions. In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most
  aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes
  were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of
  46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in
  mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower
  respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from
  3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus
  (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30
  million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in
  2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17
  million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010.
  Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between
  1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million)
  worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than
  two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus,
  and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9
  million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in
  five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in
  1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was
  marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%).
  This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic
  accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic
  heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower
  respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of
  death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke,
  diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of
  life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was
  estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs
  from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since
  1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional
  variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable,
  maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of
  premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death
  rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes
  mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases,
  death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases,
  COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For
  other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little
  change was noted. Population growth, increased average age of the world's
  population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and
  cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable,
  maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases.
  Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain
  the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general
  pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists
  in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer,
  diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and
  others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound
  epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. Bill &

    \field{abstract}{%
    Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease
  occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance
  of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the
  effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of
  the world is unknown. We established a standardised case-control study of
  acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited
  continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of
  smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary
  patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins
  (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here.
  Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to
  myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were
  calculated. Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7% for
  current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest
  quintile, PAR 49.2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of
  hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9%), abdominal obesity
  (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR
  20.1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67,
  PAR 32.5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0.70, PAR 13.7% for
  lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0.91, PAR 6.7%), and
  regular physical activity (0.86, PAR 12.2%), were all significantly related
  to acute myocardial infarction (p<0.0001 for all risk factors and p=0.03 for
  alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and
  in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted
  for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Abnormal lipids, smoking,
  hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption
  of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for
  most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all
  ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can
  be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent
  most premature cases of myocardial infarction.%

    To derive a new cardiovascular disease risk score (QRISK) for the United
  Kingdom and to validate its performance against the established Framingham
  cardiovascular disease algorithm and a newly developed Scottish score
  (ASSIGN). Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from
  general practice. UK practices contributing to the QRESEARCH database. The
  derivation cohort consisted of 1.28 million patients, aged 35-74 years,
  registered at 318 practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007 and who
  were free of diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The validation
  cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices. First recorded
  diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (incident diagnosis between 1 January
  1995 and 1 April 2007): myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease,
  stroke, and transient ischaemic attacks. Risk factors were age, sex, smoking
  status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol to high
  density lipoprotein, body mass index, family history of coronary heart
  disease in first degree relative aged less than 60, area measure of
  deprivation, and existing treatment with antihypertensive agent. A
  cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK) was developed in the derivation
  cohort. In the validation cohort the observed 10 year risk of a
  cardiovascular event was 6.60% (95% confidence interval 6.48% to 6.72%) in
  women and 9.28% (9.14% to 9.43%) in men. Overall the Framingham algorithm
  over-predicted cardiovascular disease risk at 10 years by 35%, ASSIGN by 36%,
  and QRISK by 0.4%. Measures of discrimination tended to be higher for QRISK
  than for the Framingham algorithm and it was better calibrated to the UK
  population than either the Framingham or ASSIGN models. Using QRISK 8.5% of
  patients aged 35-74 are at high risk (20% risk or higher over 10 years)
  compared with 13% when using the Framingham algorithm and 14% when using
  ASSIGN. Using QRISK 34% of women and 73% of men aged 64-75 would be at high
  risk compared with 24% and 86% according to the Framingham algorithm. UK
  estimates for 2005 based on QRISK give 3.2 million patients aged 35-74 at
  high risk, with the Framingham algorithm predicting 4.7 million and ASSIGN
  5.1 million. Overall, 53 668 patients in the validation dataset (9% of the
  total) would be reclassified from high to low risk or vice versa using QRISK
  compared with the Framingham algorithm. QRISK performed at least as well as
  the Framingham model for discrimination and was better calibrated to the UK
  population than either the Framingham model or ASSIGN. QRISK is likely to
  provide more appropriate risk estimates to help identify high risk patients
  on the basis of age, sex, and social deprivation. It is therefore likely to
  be a more equitable tool to inform management decisions and help ensure
  treatments are directed towards those most likely to benefit. It includes
  additional variables which improve risk estimates for patients with a
  positive family history or those on antihypertensive treatment. However,
  since the validation was performed in a similar population to the population
  from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage."
  Further validation in other populations is therefore required.%

    To develop and validate version two of the QRISK cardiovascular disease
  risk algorithm (QRISK2) to provide accurate estimates of cardiovascular risk
  in patients from different ethnic groups in England and Wales and to compare
  its performance with the modified version of Framingham score recommended by
  the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Prospective
  open cohort study with routinely collected data from general practice, 1
  January 1993 to 31 March 2008. 531 practices in England and Wales
  contributing to the national QRESEARCH database. 2.3 million patients aged
  35-74 (over 16 million person years) with 140,000 cardiovascular events.
  Overall population (derivation and validation cohorts) comprised 2.22 million
  people who were white or whose ethnic group was not recorded, 22,013 south
  Asian, 11,595 black African, 10,402 black Caribbean, and 19,792 from Chinese
  or other Asian or other ethnic groups. First (incident) diagnosis of
  cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient
  ischaemic attack) recorded in general practice records or linked Office for
  National Statistics death certificates. Risk factors included self assigned
  ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total
  serum cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index,
  family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative under 60
  years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
  renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis. The validation
  statistics indicated that QRISK2 had improved discrimination and calibration
  compared with the modified Framingham score. The QRISK2 algorithm explained
  43% of the variation in women and 38% in men compared with 39% and 35%,
  respectively, by the modified Framingham score. Of the 112,156 patients
  classified as high risk (that is, >or=20% risk over 10 years) by the modified
  Framingham score, 46,094 (41.1%) would be reclassified at low risk with
  QRISK2. The 10 year observed risk among these reclassified patients was 16.6%
  (95% confidence interval 16.1% to 17.0%)-that is, below the 20% treatment
  threshold. Of the 78 024 patients classified at high risk on QRISK2, 11,962
  (15.3%) would be reclassified at low risk by the modified Framingham score.
  The 10 year observed risk among these patients was 23.3% (22.2% to
  24.4%)-that is, above the 20% threshold. In the validation cohort, the annual
  incidence rate of cardiovascular events among those with a QRISK2 score of
  >or=20% was 30.6 per 1000 person years (29.8 to 31.5) for women and 32.5 per
  1000 person years (31.9 to 33.1) for men. The corresponding figures for the
  modified Framingham equation were 25.7 per 1000 person years (25.0 to 26.3)
  for women and 26.4 (26.0 to 26.8) for men). At the 20% threshold, the
  population identified by QRISK2 was at higher risk of a CV event than the
  population identified by the Framingham score. Incorporating ethnicity,
  deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk
  of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at
  high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20% threshold,
  QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment
  decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the
  validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which
  the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further
  validation in other populations is therefore advised.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) is developed based on the use of
  clinical risk factors with or without bone mineral density tests applied to
  the UK. The aim of this study was to apply an assessment tool for the
  prediction of fracture in men and women with the use of clinical risk factors
  (CRFs) for fracture with and without the use of femoral neck bone mineral
  density (BMD). The clinical risk factors, identified from previous
  meta-analyses, comprised body mass index (BMI, as a continuous variable), a
  prior history of fracture, a parental history of hip fracture, use of oral
  glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis and other secondary causes of
  osteoporosis, current smoking, and alcohol intake 3 or more units daily. Four
  models were constructed to compute fracture probabilities based on the
  epidemiology of fracture in the UK. The models comprised the ten-year
  probability of hip fracture, with and without femoral neck BMD, and the
  ten-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture, with and without BMD.
  For each model fracture and death hazards were computed as continuous
  functions. Each clinical risk factor contributed to fracture probability. In
  the absence of BMD, hip fracture probability in women with a fixed BMI (25
  kg/m(2)) ranged from 0.2% at the age of 50 years for women without CRF's to
  22% at the age of 80 years with a parental history of hip fracture
  (approximately 100-fold range). In men, the probabilities were lower, as was
  the range (0.1 to 11% in the examples above). For a major osteoporotic
  fracture the probabilities ranged from 3.5% to 31% in women, and from 2.8% to
  15% in men in the example above. The presence of one or more risk factors
  increased probabilities in an incremental manner. The differences in
  probabilities between men and women were comparable at any given T-score and
  age, except in the elderly where probabilities were higher in women than in
  men due to the higher mortality of the latter. The models provide a framework
  which enhances the assessment of fracture risk in both men and women by the
  integration of clinical risk factors alone and/or in combination with BMD.%

    Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which
  patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, as well as to
  risk-adjust readmission rates for the purposes of hospital comparison. To
  summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their
  performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use. The
  databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from
  inception through March 2011, the EMBASE database was searched through August
  2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual
  review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of
  prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and
  validation cohorts. Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample
  size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and
  calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection. Of 7843
  citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion
  criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model
  specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied
  on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust
  readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large
  US populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range:
  0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk
  patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range:
  0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range:
  0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and
  2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model
  discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical
  comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables
  associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social
  determinants of health. Most current readmission risk prediction models that
  were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly.
  Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve
  their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread.%

    Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in
  Europe and the United States. Survival is strongly related to stage at
  diagnosis and population-based screening reduces colorectal cancer incidence
  and mortality. Stratifying the population by risk offers the potential to
  improve the efficiency of screening. In this systematic review we searched
  Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for primary research studies
  reporting or validating models to predict future risk of primary colorectal
  cancer for asymptomatic individuals. A total of 12,808 papers were identified
  from the literature search and nine through citation searching. Fifty-two
  risk models were included. Where reported (n = 37), half the models had
  acceptable-to-good discrimination (the area under the receiver operating
  characteristic curve, AUROC >0.7) in the derivation sample. Calibration was
  less commonly assessed (n = 21), but overall acceptable. In external
  validation studies, 10 models showed acceptable discrimination (AUROC
  0.71-0.78). These include two with only three variables (age, gender, and
  BMI; age, gender, and family history of colorectal cancer). A small number of
  prediction models developed from case-control studies of genetic biomarkers
  also show some promise but require further external validation using
  population-based samples. Further research should focus on the feasibility
  and impact of incorporating such models into stratified screening
  programmes.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Prediction models are developed to aid healthcare providers in estimating
  the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present
  (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future
  (prognostic models), to inform their decision-making. However, the
  overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model
  studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all
  aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of
  prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a
  multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)
  initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies
  developing, validating or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic
  or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was
  developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was
  created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a
  3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, healthcare professionals and
  journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering
  group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors.
  The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential
  for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement
  aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study
  regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in
  conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the
  editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended
  that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also
  available at www.tripod-statement.org).%

    The Framingham Heart Study produced sex-specific coronary heart disease
  (CHD) prediction functions for assessing risk of developing incident CHD in a
  white middle-class population. Concern exists regarding whether these
  functions can be generalized to other populations. To test the validity and
  transportability of the Framingham CHD prediction functions per a National
  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop organized for this purpose.
  Sex-specific CHD functions were derived from Framingham data for prediction
  of coronary death and myocardial infarction. These functions were applied to
  6 prospectively studied, ethnically diverse cohorts (n = 23 424), including
  whites, blacks, Native Americans, Japanese American men, and Hispanic men:
  the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987-1988), Physicians' Health
  Study (1982), Honolulu Heart Program (1980-1982), Puerto Rico Heart Health
  Program (1965-1968), Strong Heart Study (1989-1991), and Cardiovascular
  Health Study (1989-1990). The performance, or ability to accurately predict
  CHD risk, of the Framingham functions compared with the performance of risk
  functions developed specifically from the individual cohorts' data.
  Comparisons included evaluation of the equality of relative risks for
  standard CHD risk factors, discrimination, and calibration. For white men and
  women and for black men and women the Framingham functions performed
  reasonably well for prediction of CHD events within 5 years of follow-up.
  Among Japanese American and Hispanic men and Native American women, the
  Framingham functions systematically overestimated the risk of 5-year CHD
  events. After recalibration, taking into account different prevalences of
  risk factors and underlying rates of developing CHD, the Framingham functions
  worked well in these populations. The sex-specific Framingham CHD prediction
  functions perform well among whites and blacks in different settings and can
  be applied to other ethnic groups after recalibration for differing
  prevalences of risk factors and underlying rates of CHD events.%

    Stratification of population groups according to cardiovascular risk level
  is recommended for primary prevention. To assess whether the Framingham
  models could accurately predict the absolute risk of coronary heart disease
  (CHD) and stroke in a large cohort of middle-aged European patients with
  hypertension, and rank individual patients according to actual risk. A
  prospective cohort study comparing the actual risk with that predicted by
  either the Framingham equations or models derived from the INSIGHT study.
  From the INSIGHT prospective trial, conducted in eight countries of Western
  Europe and Israel, we selected 4407 European patients younger than 75 years
  without previous cardiovascular events. None. Major cardiovascular events. In
  this population (45% men, mean age 64.1 years), 124 (2.8%) patients had CHD
  and 96 (2.2%) had strokes after a median follow-up of 3.7 years.
  Overestimation of absolute CHD risk by the Framingham equation was observed
  in all countries (from 2% in the UK to 7% in France), whereas predicted risk
  of stroke was close to the actual risk. However, patients in the highest risk
  quintile within each country had a threefold greater risk of a cardiovascular
  event than those in the lowest quintile. The Framingham models should not be
  used to predict absolute CHD risk in the European population as a whole.
  However, these models may be used within each country, provided that cut-off
  points defining high-risk patients have been determined within each country.%

     To directly compare the performance and externally validate the three
  most studied prediction tools for osteoporotic fractures-QFracture, FRAX, and
  Garvan-using data from electronic health records.  Retrospective cohort
  study.  Payer provider healthcare organisation in Israel.  1 054 815
  members aged 50 to 90 years for comparison between tools and cohorts of
  different age ranges, corresponding to those in each tools' development
  study, for tool specific external validation.  First diagnosis of a major
  osteoporotic fracture (for QFracture and FRAX tools) and hip fractures (for
  all three tools) recorded in electronic health records from 2010 to 2014.
  Observed fracture rates were compared to probabilities predicted
  retrospectively as of 2010.  The observed five year hip fracture rate was
  2.7% and the rate for major osteoporotic fractures was 7.7%. The areas under
  the receiver operating curve (AUC) for hip fracture prediction were 82.7% for
  QFracture, 81.5% for FRAX, and 77.8% for Garvan. For major osteoporotic
  fractures, AUCs were 71.2% for QFracture and 71.4% for FRAX. All the tools
  underestimated the fracture risk, but the average observed to predicted
  ratios and the calibration slopes of FRAX were closest to 1. Tool specific
  validation analyses yielded hip fracture prediction AUCs of 88.0% for
  QFracture (among those aged 30-100 years), 81.5% for FRAX (50-90 years), and
  71.2% for Garvan (60-95 years).  Both QFracture and FRAX had high
  discriminatory power for hip fracture prediction, with QFracture performing
  slightly better. This performance gap was more pronounced in previous
  studies, likely because of broader age inclusion criteria for QFracture
  validations. The simpler FRAX performed almost as well as QFracture for hip
  fracture prediction, and may have advantages if some of the input data

    \field{abstract}{%
    Clinical prediction models are increasingly used to complement clinical
  reasoning and decision-making in modern medicine, in general, and in the
  cardiovascular domain, in particular. To these ends, developed models first
  and foremost need to provide accurate and (internally and externally)
  validated estimates of probabilities of specific health conditions or
  outcomes in the targeted individuals. Subsequently, the adoption of such
  models by professionals must guide their decision-making, and improve patient
  outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of care. In the first paper of this
  series of two companion papers, issues relating to prediction model
  development, their internal validation, and estimating the added value of a
  new (bio)marker to existing predictors were discussed. In this second paper,
  an overview is provided of the consecutive steps for the assessment of the
  model's predictive performance in new individuals (external validation
  studies), how to adjust or update existing models to local circumstances or
  with new predictors, and how to investigate the impact of the uptake of
  prediction models on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes (impact
  studies). Each step is illustrated with empirical examples from the
  cardiovascular field.%

    The objective of this study was to investigate the association of
  spirometry and pulmonary CT biomarkers with cardiovascular events. In this
  lung cancer screening trial 3,080 male participants without a prior
  cardiovascular event were analysed. Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events
  were included. Spirometry included forced expiratory volume measured in units
  of one-second percent predicted (FEV1%predicted) and FEV1 divided by forced
  vital capacity (FVC; FEV1/FVC). CT examinations were quantified for coronary
  artery calcium volume, pulmonary emphysema (perc15) and bronchial wall
  thickness (pi10). Data were analysed via a Cox proportional hazard analysis,
  net reclassification improvement (NRI) and C-indices. 184 participants
  experienced a cardiovascular event during a median follow-up of 2.9 years.
  Age, pack-years and smoking status adjusted hazard ratios were 0.992 (95%
  confidence interval (CI) 0.985-0.999) for FEV1%predicted, 1.000 (95%CI
  0.986-1.015) for FEV1/FVC, 1.014 (95%CI 1.005-1.023) for perc15 per 10 HU,
  and 1.269 (95%CI 1.024-1.573) for pi10 per 1 mm. The incremental C-index
  (<0.015) and NRI (<2.8%) were minimal. Coronary artery calcium volume had a
  hazard ratio of 1.046 (95%CI 1.034-1.058) per 100 mm(3), an increase in
  C-index of 0.076 and an NRI of 16.9% (P < 0.0001). Pulmonary CT biomarkers
  and spirometry measurements were significantly associated with cardiovascular
  events, but did not contain clinically relevant independent prognostic
  information for cardiovascular events. • Pulmonary CT biomarkers and
  spirometry are associated with cardiovascular events • These pulmonary
  measurements do not contain clinically relevant independent prognostic
  information • Only coronary calcium score improved cardiovascular risk
  prediction above age and smoking.%

    The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of coronary artery
  calcium (CAC) on the classification of 10-year hard coronary heart disease
  (CHD) risk and to empirically derive cut-off values of the calcium score for
  a general population of elderly patients. Although CAC scoring has been found
  to improve CHD risk prediction, there are limited data on its impact in
  clinical practice. The study comprised 2,028 asymptomatic participants (age
  69.6 ± 6.2 years) from the Rotterdam Study. During a median follow-up of 9.2
  years, 135 hard coronary events occurred. Persons were classified into low
  (<10%), intermediate (10% to 20%), and high (>20%) 10-year coronary risk
  categories based on a Framingham refitted risk model. In a second step, the
  model was extended by CAC, and reclassification percentages were calculated.
  Cutoff values of CAC for persons in the intermediate-risk category were
  empirically derived based on 10-year hard CHD risk. Reclassification by means
  of CAC scoring was most substantial in persons initially classified as
  intermediate risk. In this group, 52% of men and women were reclassified, all
  into more accurate risk categories. CAC values above 615 or below 50 Agatston
  units were found appropriate to reclassify persons into high or low risk,
  respectively. In a general population of elderly patients at intermediate CHD
  risk, CAC scoring is a powerful method to reclassify persons into more
  appropriate risk categories. Empirically derived CAC cutoff values at which
  persons at intermediate risk reclassified to either high or low risk were 615
  and 50 Agatston units, respectively.%

    The purpose of this study was to determine net reclassification improvement
  (NRI) and improved risk prediction based on coronary artery calcification
  (CAC) scoring in comparison with traditional risk factors. CAC as a sign of
  subclinical coronary atherosclerosis can noninvasively be detected by CT and
  has been suggested to predict coronary events. In 4,129 subjects from the HNR
  (Heinz Nixdorf Recall) study (age 45 to 75 years, 53% female) without overt
  coronary artery disease at baseline, traditional risk factors and CAC scores
  were measured. Their risk was categorized into low, intermediate, and high
  according to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and National Cholesterol
  Education Panel Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and the
  reclassification rate based on CAC results was calculated. After 5 years of
  follow-up, 93 coronary deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred
  (cumulative risk 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.8% to 2.8%). Reclassifying
  intermediate (defined as 10% to 20% and 6% to 20%) risk subjects with CAC
  <100 to the low-risk category and with CAC ≥400 to the high-risk category
  yielded an NRI of 21.7% (p = 0.0002) and 30.6% (p < 0.0001) for the FRS,
  respectively. Integrated discrimination improvement using FRS variables and
  CAC was 1.52% (p < 0.0001). Adding CAC scores to the FRS and National
  Cholesterol Education Panel ATP III categories improved the area under the
  curve from 0.681 to 0.749 (p < 0.003) and from 0.653 to 0.755 (p = 0.0001),
  respectively. CAC scoring results in a high reclassification rate in the
  intermediate-risk cohort, demonstrating the benefit of imaging of subclinical
  coronary atherosclerosis. Our study supports its application, especially in
  carefully selected individuals with intermediate risk.%

    Coronary calcification detected by electron beam tomography may improve
  cardiovascular risk prediction. The technique is particularly promising in
  the elderly because the predictive power of cardiovascular risk factors
  weakens with age. We investigated the prognostic value of coronary
  calcification for cardiovascular events and mortality in a general,
  asymptomatic population of elderly subjects. From 1997 to 2000, electron beam
  tomography scanning to assess coronary calcification was performed in
  subjects of the population-based Rotterdam Study. Risk factors were measured
  by standardized procedures. Coronary calcium scores were available for 1795
  asymptomatic participants (mean age, 71 years; range, 62 to 85 years). During
  a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, 88 cardiovascular events, including 50
  coronary events, occurred. The risk of coronary heart disease increased with
  increasing calcium score. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of coronary
  events was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.2 to 7.9) for calcium scores of 101 to 400, 4.6
  (95% CI, 1.8 to 11.8) for calcium scores of 401 to 1000, and 8.3 (95% CI, 3.3
  to 21.1) for calcium scores >1000 compared with calcium scores of 0 to 100.
  The predictive value in subjects >70 years of age was similar. Risk
  prediction based on the cardiovascular risk factors improved when coronary
  calcification was added. Coronary calcification is a strong and independent
  predictor of coronary heart disease, also in the elderly. Coronary
  calcification improves prediction of coronary events based on cardiovascular
  risk factors. Risk stratification by assessment of coronary calcification may
  have an important role in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease
  events in the elderly.%

    Coronary calcifications are specific markers for coronary atherosclerosis.
  The amount of coronary calcium is related to the likelihood of vulnerable
  plaques. Vulnerable plaques may rupture and may result in sudden coronary
  thrombus formation, occlusion, ischemia and ventricular fibrillation and
  finally cardiac death. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the risk
  of cardiac events can be assessed by the quantification of the extent of
  coronary calcium. However, until now, the predictive value of coronary
  calcium and the advantage over conventional risk factors has not yet been
  proven by any prospective cohort study. In practice uncertainty exists in the
  group of patients with an intermediate risk for cardiac events. In this
  particular cohort it is likely that the assessment of coronary
  atherosclerosis may help in the decision to initiate or discard a specific
  therapy. For this purpose it has been suggested to replace the Framingham age
  score by a score corrected by the amount of coronary calcium. Follow-up
  investigations may be helpful in the short term to determine the efficiency
  of different therapeutical options. To determine a significant progression of
  the amount of coronary calcium, the absolute mass should be determined in a
  period of 1 year.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Patients without symptoms who have positive stress test results are often
  referred for diagnostic catheter angiography in an evaluation for coronary
  artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to use decision tree
  analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness and radiation dose that would
  result from performing coronary CT angiography (CTA) before catheterization.
  A decision tree was constructed to compare the false-negative rates,
  false-positive rates, costs, and radiation exposure of direct referral of
  patients for cardiac catheterization with the values associated with
  performing coronary CTA before catheterization. We assumed that patients
  referred for coronary CTA proceed to catheterization only when significant
  disease is identified. Costs for coronary CTA and diagnostic catheterization
  were obtained from the 2009 physician Medicare fee schedule. Sensitivity,
  specificity, and radiation dose were obtained by literature review. Cost
  reduction with coronary CTA depends on the prevalence of coronary artery
  disease, but overall costs are reduced as long as the prevalence is less than
  85%. At a 50% prevalence of coronary artery disease, performing coronary CTA
  before cardiac catheterization results in an average cost saving of $789 per
  patient with a false-negative rate of 2.5% and average additional radiation
  exposure of 1-2 mSv. Performing coronary CTA before cardiac catheterization
  is a cost-effective strategy in the care of patients without symptoms who
  have positive stress test results when the probability that the patient has
  significant coronary artery disease is less than 50%. The false-negative rate
  with this strategy compares favorably with the false-negative rate of stress
  testing. The use of coronary CTA in this role can avoid many unnecessary
  cardiac catheterization procedures.%

    Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is frequently detected on low-dose
  ungated MDCT performed for lung cancer screening. We aimed to determine the
  concordance of CAC scores on low-dose ungated and regular-dose ECG-gated
  MDCT. The subjects were 513 patients consecutively registered for health
  screening and undergoing both low-dose ungated (120 kVp, 20 mAs) and
  regular-dose ECG-gated MDCT (120 kVp, 150 mAs, retrospective ECG gating). The
  first 30 cases were used for protocol optimization and a training session.
  Agatston score on regular-dose ECG-gated and low-dose ungated MDCT in the
  other 483 cases (320 men; mean age, 62.2 +/- 13.2 [SD] years) was calculated
  by two observers in a blinded manner. Interobserver and intertechnique
  scoring variability and concordance were calculated. The mean of
  interobserver scoring variability for regular-dose ECG-gated MDCT was 3.6%
  and for low-dose ungated MDCT was 9.6%. Regular-dose ECG-gated MDCT depicted
  CAC in 221 (46%) of the subjects. With low-dose ungated MDCT, observers 1 and
  2, respectively, had five and seven false-positive and five and four
  false-negative predictions. All the miscategorized scores were 12 or less.
  The negative predictive values of CAC on low-dose ungated MDCT were 98% and
  99% for observers 1 and 2, respectively. For patients with CAC, the mean
  intertechnique scoring variability was 40-43%. For all 483 subjects, the
  intertechnique concordance of the four major score ranks (0, 1-100, 101-400,
  > 400) was high (kappa = 0.89 for the two observers). Low-dose ungated MDCT
  with an optimized protocol is reliable for prediction of the presence of CAC
  and categorization of the four major Agatston score ranks. This technique may
  be useful for coronary artery disease risk stratification of persons
  undergoing low-dose ungated MDCT for lung cancer screening.%

    Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and thoracic aortic calcification,
  (TAC) are frequently detected on ungated multidetector computed tomography
  (MDCT) performed for lung evaluations. We sought to evaluate concordance of
  CAC and TAC scores on ungated (thoracic) and electrocardiogaphically
  (ECG)-gated (cardiac) MDCT scans. Fifty patients, enrolled in the Genetic
  Epidemiology of COPD study (COPDGene), were recruited to undergo gated CAC
  scans with 64-detector row CT, in addition to the ungated thoracic studies
  already being obtained as part of their study evaluation. Coronary and
  thoracic calcium were measured similarly (Agatston score, requiring 3
  contiguous voxels of >130 Hounsfield units) with low-dose ungated studies and
  ECG-gated MDCT performed at the same scanning session. Intertechnique scoring
  variability and concordance were calculated. Correlations between gated and
  ungated CAC and TAC were excellent (r = 0.96). The relative differences
  (median variability) measured by ECG-gated versus ungated MDCT were
  relatively high for CAC (44%) but not for TAC (8%). Prevalence of depicted
  CAC (n = 33; 66%) and TAC (n = 21; 42%) were coincident between ECG-gated and
  ungated MDCT, respectively (intertechnique concordance, 100%). Bland-Altman
  plots for CAC showed mean differences of 354 (confidence interval, 169-538)
  and 16.1 (confidence interval, -89 to 121). Low-dose ungated MDCT is reliable
  for prediction of the presence of CAC and assessment of Agatston score.
  Concordance between methods and between TAC and CAC is high. This technique
  should allow for atherosclerotic disease risk stratification among patients
  undergoing ungated lung CT evaluation without requiring additional scanning.
  Measurement of TAC is almost as accurate from gated CT, and CAC scores are
  highly concordant.%

    The coronary artery calcium score (CACS) has been shown to predict future
  coronary heart disease (CHD) events. However, the extent to which adding CACS
  to traditional CHD risk factors improves classification of risk is unclear.
  To determine whether adding CACS to a prediction model based on traditional
  risk factors improves classification of risk. CACS was measured by computed
  tomography in 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of
  Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based cohort without known
  cardiovascular disease. Recruitment spanned July 2000 to September 2002;
  follow-up extended through May 2008. Participants with diabetes were excluded
  from the primary analysis. Five-year risk estimates for incident CHD were
  categorized as 0% to less than 3%, 3% to less than 10%, and 10% or more using
  Cox proportional hazards models. Model 1 used age, sex, tobacco use, systolic
  blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, total and high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, and race/ethnicity. Model 2 used these risk factors
  plus CACS. We calculated the net reclassification improvement and compared
  the distribution of risk using model 2 vs model 1. Incident CHD events.
  During a median of 5.8 years of follow-up among a final cohort of 5878, 209
  CHD events occurred, of which 122 were myocardial infarction, death from CHD,
  or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Model 2 resulted in significant improvements
  in risk prediction compared with model 1 (net reclassification improvement =
  0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.34; P < .001). In model 1, 69% of the
  cohort was classified in the highest or lowest risk categories compared with
  77% in model 2. An additional 23% of those who experienced events were
  reclassified as high risk, and an additional 13% without events were
  reclassified as low risk using model 2. In this multi-ethnic cohort, addition
  of CACS to a prediction model based on traditional risk factors significantly
  improved the classification of risk and placed more individuals in the most
  extreme risk categories.%

    Guidelines advise that all adults undergo coronary heart disease (CHD) risk
  assessment to guide preventive treatment intensity. Although the Framingham
  Risk Score (FRS) is often recommended for this, it has been suggested that
  risk assessment may be improved by additional tests such as coronary artery
  calcium scoring (CACS). To determine whether CACS assessment combined with
  FRS in asymptomatic adults provides prognostic information superior to either
  method alone and whether the combined approach can more accurately guide
  primary preventive strategies in patients with CHD risk factors. Prospective
  observational population-based study, of 1461 asymptomatic adults with
  coronary risk factors. Participants with at least 1 coronary risk factor (>45
  years) underwent computed tomography (CT) examination, were screened between
  1990-1992, were contacted yearly for up to 8.5 years after CT scan, and were
  assessed for CHD. This analysis included 1312 participants with CACS results;
  excluded were 269 participants with diabetes and 14 participants with either
  missing data or had a coronary event before CACS was performed. Nonfatal
  myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. During a median of 7.0 years of
  follow-up, 84 patients experienced MI or CHD death; 70 patients died of any
  cause. There were 291 (28%) participants with an FRS of more than 20% and 221
  (21%) with a CACS of more than 300. Compared with an FRS of less than 10%, an
  FRS of more than 20% predicted the risk of MI or CHD death (hazard ratio
  [HR], 14.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 2.0-104; P =.009). Compared with a
  CACS of zero, a CACS of more than 300 was predictive (HR, 3.9; 95% CI,
  2.1-7.3; P<.001). Across categories of FRS, CACS was predictive of risk among
  patients with an FRS higher than 10% (P<.001) but not with an FRS less than
  10%. These data support the hypothesis that high CACS can modify predicted
  risk obtained from FRS alone, especially among patients in the
  intermediate-risk category in whom clinical decision making is most
  uncertain.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death among adults
  in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk
  factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort
  Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk
  assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment
  might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the
  harms. To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
  recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease
  risk assessment. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional
  risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index
  (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery
  calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and
  treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham
  Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk
  assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to
  existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration,
  discrimination, and risk reclassification. The USPSTF found adequate evidence
  that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk
  assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk
  reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely
  unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled
  Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess
  whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in
  addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to
  reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate
  evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions
  as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
  assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or
  CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD
  events. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
  assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or
  CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to
  prevent CVD events. (I statement).%

    Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit
  emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool
  used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a
  radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed
  treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in
  emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine
  clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed
  fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors
  in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect
  and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate
  the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them
  annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with
  emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures
  in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning
  model. The average clinician's sensitivity was 80.8% (95% CI, 76.7-84.1%)
  unaided and 91.5% (95% CI, 89.3-92.9%) aided, and specificity was 87.5% (95
  CI, 85.3-89.5%) unaided and 93.9% (95% CI, 92.9-94.9%) aided. The average
  clinician experienced a relative reduction in misinterpretation rate of 47.0%
  (95% CI, 37.4-53.9%). The significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy
  that we observed in this study show that deep learning methods are a
  mechanism by which senior medical specialists can deliver their expertise to
  generalists on the front lines of medicine, thereby providing substantial
  improvements to patient care.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The breast stromal microenvironment is a pivotal factor in breast cancer
  development, growth and metastases. Although pathologists often detect
  morphologic changes in stroma by light microscopy, visual classification of
  such changes is subjective and non-quantitative, limiting its diagnostic
  utility. To gain insights into stromal changes associated with breast cancer,
  we applied automated machine learning techniques to digital images of 2387
  hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections of benign and malignant
  image-guided breast biopsies performed to investigate mammographic
  abnormalities among 882 patients, ages 40-65 years, that were enrolled in the
  Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project.
  Using deep convolutional neural networks, we trained an algorithm to
  discriminate between stroma surrounding invasive cancer and stroma from
  benign biopsies. In test sets (928 whole-slide images from 330 patients),
  this algorithm could distinguish biopsies diagnosed as invasive cancer from
  benign biopsies solely based on the stromal characteristics (area under the
  receiver operator characteristics curve = 0.962). Furthermore, without
  being trained specifically using ductal carcinoma in situ as an outcome, the
  algorithm detected tumor-associated stroma in greater amounts and at larger
  distances from grade 3 versus grade 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively,
  these results suggest that algorithms based on deep convolutional neural
  networks that evaluate only stroma may prove useful to classify breast
  biopsies and aid in understanding and evaluating the biology of breast
  lesions.%

    Chest diseases are very serious health problems in the life of people.
  These diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia,
  asthma, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. The timely diagnosis of chest
  diseases is very important. Many methods have been developed for this
  purpose. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying the
  chest pathologies in chest X-rays using conventional and deep learning
  approaches. In the paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are presented
  for the diagnosis of chest diseases. The architecture of CNN and its design
  principle are presented. For comparative purpose, backpropagation neural
  networks (BPNNs) with supervised learning, competitive neural networks
  (CpNNs) with unsupervised learning are also constructed for diagnosis chest
  diseases. All the considered networks CNN, BPNN, and CpNN are trained and
  tested on the same chest X-ray database, and the performance of each network
  is discussed. Comparative results in terms of accuracy, error rate, and
  training time between the networks are presented.%

    The calcium burden as estimated from non-ECG-synchronized computed
  tomography (CT) exams acquired in screening of heavy smokers has been shown
  to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. We present a method for
  automatic coronary calcium scoring with low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced,
  non-ECG-synchronized chest CT. First, a probabilistic coronary calcium map
  was created using multi-atlas segmentation. This map assigned an a priori
  probability for the presence of coronary calcifications at every location in
  a scan. Subsequently, a statistical pattern recognition system was designed
  to identify coronary calcifications by texture, size, and spatial features;
  the spatial features were computed using the coronary calcium map. The
  detected calcifications were quantified in terms of volume and Agatston
  score. The best results were obtained by merging the results of three
  different supervised classification systems, namely direct classification
  with a nearest neighbor classifier, and two-stage classification with nearest
  neighbor and support vector machine classifiers.We used a total of 231 test
  scans containing 45,674 mm³ of coronary calcifications. The presented method
  detected on average 157/198 mm³ (sensitivity 79.2%) of coronary calcium
  volume with on average 4 mm false positive volume. Calcium scoring can be
  performed automatically in low-dose, non-contrast enhanced,
  non-ECG-synchronized chest CT in screening of heavy smokers to identify
  subjects who might benefit from preventive treatment.%

    To evaluate the incremental prognostic value of the number and maximum
  volume of coronary artery calcifications over modified Agatston score strata,
  age, pack-years, and smoking status for predicting cardiovascular events. A
  total of 3559 male current and former smokers received a CT examination for
  lung cancer screening. Smoking characteristics, patient demographics, and
  physician-diagnosed cardiovascular events were collected. Images were
  acquired without electrocardiography gating on 16-slice CT scanners. The
  association between the presence of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular
  events and the predictors was quantified using Cox proportional hazard
  analysis. Median follow-up period was 2.9 years. Incident cardiovascular
  events occurred in 186 participants. Adjusted hazard ratios for modified
  Agatston score strata of 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400 were 3.39
  (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-9.59), 6.52 (95% CI, 2.73-15.60), 6.58
  (95% CI, 2.75-15.78), and 12.58 (95% CI, 5.42-29.16), respectively. Moreover,
  comparing the models with and without modified Agatston score strata to the
  model with age, pack-years, and smoking status yielded a significantly better
  net reclassification improvement (NRI; 27.3%; P < .0001). Adding the number
  of calcifications to the model with age, pack-years, smoking status, and
  modified Agatston score strata resulted in a slightly better NRI (1.68%; P =
  .0490) with a hazard ratio of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.21) per 10 calcifications.
  The incremental prognostic information contained in the volume of the largest
  calcification was not statistically significant (NRI, 0.14%; P = .3458).
  Cardiovascular event rate increased with higher numbers of calcified lesions.
  The number but not maximum volume of calcifications has independent, although
  minimal, prognostic value over age, pack-years, smoking status, and modified
  Agatston score strata in our population.%

    Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an
  unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle
  increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success.
  Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of
  physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks
  that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the
  number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying
  industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic
  companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of
  this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such
  learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic
  concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large
  enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available
  for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying
  machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed
  meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast
  to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus,
  part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing
  the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss
  how these might be overcome.%

    As algorithms increasingly inform and influence decisions made about
  individuals, it becomes increasingly important to address concerns that these
  algorithms might be discriminatory. The output of an algorithm can be
  discriminatory for many reasons, most notably: (1) the data used to train the
  algorithm might be biased (in various ways) to favor certain populations over
  others; (2) the analysis of this training data might inadvertently or
  maliciously introduce biases that are not borne out in the data. This work
  focuses on the latter concern. We develop and study multicalbration -- a new
  measure of algorithmic fairness that aims to mitigate concerns about
  discrimination that is introduced in the process of learning a predictor from
  data. Multicalibration guarantees accurate (calibrated) predictions for every
  subpopulation that can be identified within a specified class of
  computations. We think of the class as being quite rich; in particular, it
  can contain many overlapping subgroups of a protected group. We show that in
  many settings this strong notion of protection from discrimination is both
  attainable and aligned with the goal of obtaining accurate predictions. Along
  the way, we present new algorithms for learning a multicalibrated predictor,
  study the computational complexity of this task, and draw new connections to
  computational learning models such as agnostic learning.%

    Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting
  trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some
  cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants
  to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities,
  several techniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic
  fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained
  optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying
  formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show
  that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that
  result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We
  further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a
  single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus
  maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of
  equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of
  race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally
  differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying
  prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward
  County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We
  focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we
  discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying
  out structured decision rules.%

    Electronic health records (EHRs) are an increasingly common data source for
  clinical risk prediction, presenting both unique analytic opportunities and
  challenges. We sought to evaluate the current state of EHR based risk
  prediction modeling through a systematic review of clinical prediction
  studies using EHR data. We searched PubMed for articles that reported on the
  use of an EHR to develop a risk prediction model from 2009 to 2014. Articles
  were extracted by two reviewers, and we abstracted information on study
  design, use of EHR data, model building, and performance from each
  publication and supplementary documentation. We identified 107 articles from
  15 different countries. Studies were generally very large (median sample
  size = 26 100) and utilized a diverse array of predictors. Most used
  validation techniques (n = 94 of 107) and reported model coefficients for
  reproducibility (n = 83). However, studies did not fully leverage the
  breadth of EHR data, as they uncommonly used longitudinal information
  (n = 37) and employed relatively few predictor variables (median = 27
  variables). Less than half of the studies were multicenter (n = 50) and
  only 26 performed validation across sites. Many studies did not fully address
  biases of EHR data such as missing data or loss to follow-up. Average
  c-statistics for different outcomes were: mortality (0.84), clinical
  prediction (0.83), hospitalization (0.71), and service utilization (0.71).
  EHR data present both opportunities and challenges for clinical risk
  prediction. There is room for improvement in designing such studies.%

    A health risk appraisal function has been developed for the prediction of
  stroke using the Framingham Study cohort. The stroke risk factors included in
  the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive
  therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease
  (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication),
  atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram.
  Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial
  examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox
  proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis
  of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on
  routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be
  estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke
  for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of
  stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk
  factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially
  increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk
  factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate
  multifactorial risk factor modification.%

    We sought to modify existing sex-specific health risk appraisal functions
  (profile functions) for the prediction of first stroke that better assess the
  effects of the use of antihypertensive medication. Health risk appraisal
  functions were previously developed from the Framingham Study cohort. These
  functions were Cox proportional hazards regression models relating age,
  systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior
  cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy by
  electrocardiogram, and the use of antihypertensive medication to the
  occurrence of stroke. Closer examination of the data indicated that
  antihypertensive therapy effect is present only for systolic blood pressures
  between 110 and 200 mm Hg. Adjustments to the regressions to better fit the
  observed data were developed and tested for statistical significance and
  goodness-of-fit of the model residuals. Modified functions more consistent
  with the data were developed, and, from these, tables to evaluate 10-year
  risk of first stroke were computed. The stroke profile can be used for
  evaluation of the risk of stroke and suggestion of risk factor modification
  to reduce risk. The effect of antihypertensive therapy in the evaluation of
  stroke risk can now be better evaluated.%

    To develop and validate a risk algorithm (QStroke) to estimate risk of
  stroke or transient ischaemic attack in patients without prior stroke or
  transient ischaemic attack at baseline; to compare (a) QStroke with CHADS2
  and CHA2DS2VASc scores in patients with atrial fibrillation and (b) the
  performance of QStroke with the Framingham stroke score in the full
  population free of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Prospective open
  cohort study using routinely collected data from general practice during the
  study period 1 January 1998 to 1 August 2012. 451 general practices in
  England and Wales contributing to the national QResearch database to develop
  the algorithm and 225 different QResearch practices to validate the
  algorithm. 3.5 million patients aged 25-84 years with 24.8 million person
  years in the derivation cohort who experienced 77,578 stroke events. For the
  validation cohort, we identified 1.9 million patients aged 25-84 years with
  12.7 million person years who experienced 38,404 stroke events. We excluded
  patients with a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack and
  those prescribed oral anticoagulants at study entry. Incident diagnosis of
  stroke or transient ischaemic attack recorded in general practice records or
  linked death certificates during follow-up. Self assigned ethnicity, age,
  sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum
  cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, body mass
  index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative
  under 60 years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 1
  diabetes, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary
  heart disease, congestive cardiac failure, valvular heart disease, and atrial
  fibrillation The QStroke algorithm explained 57% of the variation in women
  and 55% in men without a prior stroke. The D statistic for QStroke was 2.4 in
  women and 2.3 in men. QStroke had improved performance on all measures of
  discrimination and calibration compared with the Framingham score in patients
  without a prior stroke. Among patients with atrial fibrillation, levels of
  discrimination were lower, but QStroke had some improved performance on all
  measures of discrimination compared with CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc. QStroke
  provides a valid measure of absolute stroke risk in the general population of
  patients free of stroke or transient ischaemic attack as shown by its
  performance in a separate validation cohort. QStroke also shows some
  improvement on current risk scoring methods, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc, for the
  subset of patients with atrial fibrillation for whom anticoagulation may be
  required. Further research is needed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of
  using these algorithms in primary care.%

  propose a representation of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the
  Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that
  deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately
  predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without
  site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using
  de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical centers with 216,221
  adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 hours. In the sequential format
  we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945
  data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high
  accuracy for tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality (AUROC across
  sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged
  length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge
  diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed
  state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all cases. We also present
  a case-study of a neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how
  clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions. We believe that
  this approach can be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a
  variety of clinical scenarios, complete with explanations that directly
  highlight evidence in the patient's chart.%

    Large-scale electronic health record research introduces biases compared to
  traditional manually curated retrospective research. We used data from a
  community-acquired pneumonia study for which we had a gold standard to
  illustrate such biases. The challenges include data inaccuracy,
  incompleteness, and complexity, and they can produce in distorted results. We
  found that a naïve approach approximated the gold standard, but errors on a
  minority of cases shifted mortality substantially. Manual review revealed
  errors in both selecting and characterizing the cohort, and narrowing the
  cohort improved the result. Nevertheless, a significantly narrowed cohort
  might contain its own biases that would be difficult to estimate.%

    Clinical data describing the phenotypes and treatment of patients
  represents an underused data source that has much greater research potential
  than is currently realized. Mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has
  the potential for establishing new patient-stratification principles and for
  revealing unknown disease correlations. Integrating EHR data with genetic

    Bariatric surgery is an effective and safe approach for weight loss and
  short-term improvement in metabolic disorders such as diabetes. However,
  studies have been limited in most settings by lack of a nonsurgical group,
  losses to follow-up, missing data, and small sample sizes in clinical trials
  and observational studies. To assess the association of 3 common types of
  bariatric surgery compared with nonsurgical treatment with mortality and
  other clinical outcomes among obese patients. Retrospective cohort study in a
  large Israeli integrated health fund covering 54% of Israeli citizens with
  less than 1% turnover of members annually. Obese adult patients who underwent
  bariatric surgery between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, were
  selected and compared with obese nonsurgical patients matched on age, sex,
  body mass index (BMI), and diabetes, with a final follow-up date of December
  31, 2015. A total of 33 540 patients were included in this study. Bariatric
  surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic
  sleeve gastrectomy) or usual care obesity management only (provided by a
  primary care physician and which may include dietary counseling and behavior
  modification). The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, matched and adjusted
  for BMI prior to surgery, age, sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes,
  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking. The study
  population included 8385 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (median
  age, 46 [IQR, 37-54] years; 5490 [65.5%] women; baseline median BMI, 40.6
  [IQR, 38.5-43.7]; laparoscopic banding [n = 3635], gastric bypass
  [n = 1388], laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [n = 3362], and 25 155
  nonsurgical matched patients (median age, 46 [IQR, 37-54] years; 16 470
  [65.5%] women; baseline median BMI, 40.5 [IQR, 37.0-43.5]). The availability
  of follow-up data was 100% for all-cause mortality. There were 105 deaths
  (1.3%) among surgical patients during a median follow-up of 4.3 (IQR,
  2.8-6.6) years (including 61 [1.7%] who underwent laparoscopic banding, 18
  [1.3%] gastric bypass, and 26 [0.8%] sleeve gastrectomy), and 583 deaths
  (2.3%) among nonsurgical patients during a median follow-up of 4.0 (IQR,
  2.6-6.2) years. The absolute difference was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.86-3.15) fewer
  deaths/1000 person-years in the surgical vs nonsurgical group. Adjusted
  hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality among nonsurgical vs surgical patients were
  2.02 (95% CI, 1.63-2.52) for the entire study population; by surgical type,
  HRs were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.50-2.69) for laparoscopic banding, 2.65 (95% CI,
  1.55-4.52) for gastric bypass, and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.02-2.51) for laparoscopic
  sleeve gastrectomy. Among obese patients in a large integrated health fund in
  Israel, bariatric surgery using laparoscopic banding, gastric bypass, or
  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, compared with usual care nonsurgical obesity
  management, was associated with lower all-cause mortality over a median
  follow-up of approximately 4.5 years. The evidence of this association adds
  to the limited literature describing beneficial outcomes of these 3 types of
  bariatric surgery compared with usual care obesity management alone.%

    Knowledge of the prevalence of chronic disease in the population is
  essential for health planners and providers. To present the results of a
  concentrated effort by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel
  (Clalit Health Services) in order to develop a comprehensive register of
  chronic diseases. In 1998, all 2,704 primary care physicians in Israel's
  largest health provider were requested to report on all patients with
  selected chronic diseases. In addition, all the filled prescriptions for
  medications relevant to the investigated diseases and all relevant
  hospitalization events were added to the database. Prevalence rates were
  calculated based on the reporting practices only (1,653 physicians
  responsible for a total of 1,409,725 adults). Hypertension (10.2/100),
  diabetes (6.1/100), hyperlipidemia (5.7/100), peptic ulcer (4.7/100) and
  ischemic heart disease (4.3/100) were the most prevalent. Females had
  significantly higher rates of hypothyroidism, psychoses, neuroses and
  malignancies, and lower rates of ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease, heart failure and asthma. Arabs had higher rates of
  diabetes mellitus and lower rates of ischemic heart disease, hypertension and
  hyperlipidemia than Jews. About 20% of the adult population had one or more
  of the selected chronic diseases. Differences in rates noted between
  physicians, not explainable by population characteristics, may reflect
  differences in the quality and delivery of health services. Rate differences
  between demographic subgroups call for further studies on the etiology,
  susceptibility and natural history of these diseases.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    WHO reported that adherence among patients with chronic diseases averages
  only 50% in developed countries. This is recognized as a significant public
  health issue, since medication nonadherence leads to poor health outcomes and
  increased healthcare costs. Improving medication adherence is, therefore,
  crucial and revealed on many studies, suggesting interventions can improve
  medication adherence. One significant aspect of the strategies to improve
  medication adherence is to understand its magnitude. However, there is a lack
  of general guidance for researchers and healthcare professionals to choose
  the appropriate tools that can explore the extent of medication adherence and
  the reasons behind this problem in order to orchestrate subsequent
  interventions. This paper reviews both subjective and objective medication
  adherence measures, including direct measures, those involving secondary
  database analysis, electronic medication packaging (EMP) devices, pill count,
  and clinician assessments and self-report. Subjective measures generally
  provide explanations for patient's nonadherence whereas objective measures
  contribute to a more precise record of patient's medication-taking behavior.
  While choosing a suitable approach, researchers and healthcare professionals
  should balance the reliability and practicality, especially cost
  effectiveness, for their purpose. Meanwhile, because a perfect measure does
  not exist, a multimeasure approach seems to be the best solution currently.%

    The problem of assessing the validity and value of prognostic survival
  models presented in the literature for a particular population for which some
  data has been collected is discussed. Methods are sketched to perform
  validation through 'calibration', that is by embedding the literature model
  in a larger calibration model. This general approach is exemplified for
  x-year survival probabilities, Cox regression and general non-proportional
  hazards models. Some comments are made on basic structural changes to the
  model, described as 'revision'. Finally, general methods are discussed to
  combine models from different sources. The methods are illustrated with a
  model for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma validated on a Dutch data set.%

    Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence
  intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the
  distribution of the parameter of interest is non-symmetric. It remains
  however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with
  multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which
  are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap
  estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four
  approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods
  varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of
  missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in
  finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which
  determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young
  children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a
  sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data
  and uses the $g$-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors
  are available.%

    Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing
  cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable
  prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive
  cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing
  discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and
  challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and
  to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key
  questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk
  prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically
  significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not
  enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under
  the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main
  criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of
  prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by
  introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and
  specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures
  offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of
  these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple
  asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures
  with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists
  consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the
  performance of newer biomarkers.%
